### Introduction ###
This tutorial shows how to create a SOAP client from an existing 
WSDL, based on the same example that was used in the [server
tutorial](soap_server_tutorial.md).

The [server tutorial](soap_server_tutorial.md) shows how the
client module that is generated by `soap:wsdl2soap()` can be used. It
explains how you can call a service, with or without SOAP headers. It does
_not_ explain how the generated client can be customized. This is necessary
in particular if you want to access information in the SOAP header of the
response message. 

This document gives a more thorough description of how the generated client
module can be used, and it describes how the client can be modified to make
the SOAP header information available.

### Generating the client module ###

A module that implements an Erlang client from a WSDL can be generated
using `soap:wsdl2erlang()`. See the [SOAP reference manual](soap.md) for more
detail, and the [SOAP server tutorial](soap_server_tutorial) for an
example.

### Using the generated client ###
The client module that is generated by `soap:wsdl2erlang()` exports a
function for each of the service's operations. These functions take 3
parameters (or 4, if the option `{attachments, true}` was used when
generating the client).

1. The first argument must be the record that corresponds with the body of 
   the SOAP request. In the generated module you can find the type of that
   record, and in the generated `.hrl` file you can find a specification of
   the record. The `soap` application will encode this record and use it as the
   content of the SOAP Body.

   Alternatively it is possible to pass an `iolist()` as the first argument.
   In that case the value will be used as the value _for the complete
   request message_. In other words, the iolist must contain a complete
   SOAP envelope, with SOAP body and SOAP header, and it is not possible to
   specify SOAP header blocks separately (the second argument, see below,
   must be `[]`).

2. The second argument is a list of SOAP header blocks. If any are
   specified, these will be included in the SOAP header. 

   There are 2 ways to specify a SOAP header block:
   1. As an `iolist().` 
      This must be a valid XML snippet. It will simply be copied literally
      to the SOAP Header.

   2. As a record that corresponds to a type from the WSDL.
      This is comparable with the way the content of the SOAP body is passed.
      The record will be translated to XML by the `soap` application. 

3. The third argument is a list of options. The following options are
   available:

   1. `{http_client, module()}` - use an HTTP
      client that is different from what was specified when generating the
      client module. The `Module` must be an Erlang module that implements the
      interface that is described in [Integrating a HTTP client](integrating_a_http_client.md).
   2. `{url, URL::string()}` - use a URL that is different from the URL
      specified in the WSDL.
   3. `{timeout, Value}`. This allows to set the timeout for the request,
      in milliseconds.  It defaults to the default of the used client
      (ibrowse: 3000 milliseconds, inets/httpc: infinity). 

   All other options used here are passed on to the application that is used
   to implement the HTTP client (so the options that are available and their
   effect depends on the selected HTTP server).

4. (Only if the option `{attachments, true}` was used to generate the
   client) - Attachments to be added to the request. See [SOAP
   attachments](soap_attachments.md) for an explanation how to specify
   the attachments.
   
### Customizing the generated client
The SOAP response that is received by the client
may contain SOAP header blocks. By default these header blocks will not be
parsed, and they will not be available in the SOAP response. In order to
change that, some customization of the client module is necessary. 

This customization follows a pattern that is similar to what is done on the
server side, see the [server tutorial](soap_server_tutorial.md).

When the `soap` application finds a SOAP header block during the parsing of the
response message, it will call the client module to find out how to handle
the header block, based on the namespace of that header block. For this the
callback function `header_parser/1` is called in the client module. 

The `header_parser/1` function must return `{ok, {Parser, Start_state}}`,
where Parser is an erlsom sax callback function and a Start_state the
initial state that will be passed to the parser. The
module `soap_parsers` provides a number of possible alternatives, such as a
parser that translates the header block to a map, or a parser that simply
skips the content of the header block. For more details see [the reference
for `soap_parsers`](soap_parsers.md).

The default return value is a parser that ignores the content of the header
block (it returns `undefined`, whatever the value of the header block is).

An example of the use of this callback can be found in
["example_client.erl"](example_client.erl).
